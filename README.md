Luis Barba asked me this problem:

Suppose we have a set $S$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and we select 5 of them at random and take their convex hull.   This hull has (up to) 6 supporting halfspaces.  Then there exists a $p>0$, indepedent of $n$, such that, with probability at least $p$, every supporting halfspace contains at least $3n/4$ points from $S$.
